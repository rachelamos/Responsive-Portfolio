                            <p>My fascination with learning began in infancy, which really isn't too unique. All infants are scientists and explorers. But my fascination persisted past this age, and I hope to never lose it. My thirst for learning and languages brought me to computers and coding. I took a course in college and while I set it aside because I felt more like a physical science person, I couldn't get my mind away from it. Recently, I took the plunge into an intense coding bootcamp to immerse myself in the languages and study of coding. It's been challenging, but the thrill of creating a page by myself and learning what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can create when combined has been worth it. <br><br> My hope is that from my portfolio, you get a glimpse of what I am able to offer. My attention to detail and dedication to clean code bring websites to life that are kept running with minimal bugs due to its readibility to any developer. With my love for learning, I constantly am educating myself on what is new in the industry and what else I can bring to my clients.</p>
