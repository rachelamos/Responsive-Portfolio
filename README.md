# Responsive-Portfolio
## This is my repo for the second homework assignment - a responsive portfolio.

I built this project because I wanted to begin creating my portfolio to show to potential employers and clients. As I build this portfolio, I'll be able to showcase my work and abilities. My "About Me" section includes my goals as a developer, i.e., the hope that my code will be clean, and as of now, doesn't reflect what I believe my abilities are now.

To achieve my goal:
1. I created all three html files and began laying out what was necessary in each one.
2. The CSS file came next.
3. Here I got stuck--I didn't realize that Bootstrap would fulfill my responsive needs for acceptance. But once that was clarified, I worked on polishing my code.

My hope is that as I grow in my skills as a developer, this portfolio will continue to grow and evolve to reflect current trends in the developer world.
